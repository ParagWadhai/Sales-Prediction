# Sales-Prediction

The sales prediction project utilizing data science techniques and Python within a Jupyter Notebook aims to forecast future sales based on historical data. Leveraging various libraries such as Pandas for data manipulation, Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization, and Scikit-learn for machine learning algorithms, the project follows a systematic approach. Initially, the historical sales data is cleaned and preprocessed to handle missing values and outliers. Feature engineering may be employed to extract relevant features, followed by exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data distribution and patterns. Subsequently, different machine learning models such as linear regression, decision trees, or random forests are trained and evaluated using techniques like cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning. Finally, the best-performing model is selected to make predictions on unseen data, providing valuable insights for future sales forecasting and business decision-making.
